This library would not have been possible without the CppAlliance and its founder Vinnie Falco.
Vinnie trusted me enough to let me work on this project, while himself having very different views on how such a library should be designed.

Thanks also go to Ruben Perez & Richard Hodges for listening to my design problems and giving me advice & use-cases. Furthermore, this library would not have been possible without the great boost.asio by Chris Kohlhoff.
