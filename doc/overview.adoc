.Synchronization Functions

|===
|<<select,select>>
|A function that waits for one coroutine out of a set that is ready in a pseudo-random way, to avoid starvation.

|<<join,join>>
|A function that waits for a set of coroutines and returns all of them as value or throws an exception if any awaitable does so.


|<<gather,gather>>
|A function that waits for a set of coroutines and returns all of them as `result`, capturing all exceptions individually.

|<<left_select,left_select>>
|A deterministic `select` that evaluates left-to-right.
