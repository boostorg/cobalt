Here's a list of relevant featuers in async:

.Coroutine types
[cols="1,5"]
|===
|<<promise>>
|An eager coroutine returning a single result- consider it the default

|<<generator>>
|An eager coroutine that can yield multiple values.

|<<task>>
|A lazy version of <<promise>>

|<<detached>>
|A coroutine similar to promise, without a handle

|===


.Synchronization Functions
[cols="1,5"]
|===
|<<select>>
|A function that waits for one coroutine out of a set that is ready in a pseudo-random way, to avoid starvation.

|<<join>>
|A function that waits for a set of coroutines and returns all of them as value or throws an exception if any awaitable does so.


|<<gather>>
|A function that waits for a set of coroutines and returns all of them as `result`, capturing all exceptions individually.

|<<race>>
|A deterministic `select` that evaluates left-to-right.
|===

.Utilities
[cols="1,5"]
|===
|<<channel>>
|A thread-local utility to send values between coroutines.


|<<with>>
|An async RAII helper, that allows async teardown when exceptions occur
