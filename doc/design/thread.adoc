== Threading

This library is single-threaded by design, because this simplifies resumption
and thus more performant handling of synchronizations like <<select, select>>.

Or put another way: using primitives likes this in a multi-threaded environment,
will require a lot of locks which will cause a significant performance overhead.

That is to say: you can't have any coroutines be resumed on multiple threads,
except when using <<spawn, spawn>>.
