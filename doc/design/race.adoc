[#design:race]
== Select

The most important synchronization mechanism is the `race` function.

It awaits multiple <<awaitable,awaitable>>s in a pseudo-random order
and will return the result of the first one completion, before disregarding the rest.

That is, it initiates the `co_await` in a pseudo-random order and stops once one
awaitable is found to be ready or completed immediately.

[source,cpp]
----
cobalt::generator<int> gen1();
cobalt::generator<double> gen2();

cobalt::promise<void> p()
{
  auto g1 = gen1();
  auto g2 = gen2();
  while (!co_await cobalt::this_coro::cancelled)
  {
    switch(auto v = co_await race(g1, g2); v.index())
    {
    case 0:
      printf("Got int %d\n", get<0>(v));
      break;
    case 1:
      printf("Got double %f\n", get<1>(v));
      break;
    }
  }
}
----

The `race` must however internally wait  for all awaitable to complete
once it initiates to `co_await`.
Therefor, once the first <<awaitable, awaitable>> completes,
it tries to <<interrupt_await, interrupt>> the rest, and if that fails cancels them.

`race` is the preferred way to trigger cancellations, e.g:

[source,cpp]
----
cobalt::promise<void> timeout();
cobalt::promise<void> work();

race(timeout(), work());
----

[#design:interrupt_await]
== interrupt_await

If it naively cancelled it would however lose data.
Thus, the concept of  `interrupt_await` is introduced,
which tells the awaitable (that supports it)
to immediately resume the awaiter and return or throw an ignored value.

.Example of an interruptible awaitable
[source,cpp]
----
struct awaitable
{
   bool await_ready() const;

   template<typename Promise>
   std::coroutine_handle<void> await_suspend(std::coroutine_handle<Promise> h);

   T await_resume();

   void interrupt_await() &;
};
----

If the `interrupt_await` doesn't result in immediate resumption (of `h`),
`race` will send a cancel signal.

`race` applies these with the correct reference qualification:

[source,cpp]
----
auto g = gen1();
race(g, gen2());
----

The above will call a `interrupt_await() &` function for `g1` and `interrupt_await() &&` for `g2` if available.

NOTE: Generally speaking, the coroutines in `cobalt` support lvalue interruption, i.e. `interrupt_await() &`.
<<channel,channel>> operations are unqualified, i.e. work in both cases.

<<join,join>> and <<gather, gather>> will forward interruptions,
i.e. this will only interrupt `g1` and `g2` if `gen2()` completes first:
