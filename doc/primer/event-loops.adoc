== Event Loops

Since the coroutines in `async` can `co_await` events, they need to be run on an event-loop.
That is another piece of code is responsible for tracking outstanding event and resume a resuming coroutines that are awaiting them.
This pattern is very common and is used in a similar way by node.js or python's `asyncio`.

`async` uses an https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/master/doc/html/boost_asio/reference/io_context.html[`asio::io_context`] as its default event loop.

The event loop is accessed through an executor (following the asio terminology) and can be manually set using <<this_thread, set_executor>>.
