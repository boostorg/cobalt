== Event Loops

Since the coroutines in `async` can `co_await` events,
they need to be run on an event-loop.
That is another piece of code is responsible for tracking 
outstanding events and resume a co_await coroutine.
This pattern is very common and is used in a similar way 
by node.js or python's `asyncio`.

`async` uses an `asio::io_context` as it's main event loop.
