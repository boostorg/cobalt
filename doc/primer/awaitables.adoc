== Awaitables

Awaitables are types that can be used in a `co_await` expression.

[source,cpp,subs="+quotes"]
----
struct awaitable_prototype
{
    bool await_ready();

    template<typename T>
    __see_below__ await_suspend(std::coroutine_handle<T>);

    __return_type__  await_resume();
};
----

NOTE: Type will be implicitly converted into an awaitable if there is an `operator co_await` call available.
This documentation will use `awaitable` to include these types,
and "actual_awaitable" to refer to type conforming to the above prototype.

In a `co_await` expression the waiting coroutine will first invoke
`await_ready` to check if the coroutine needs to suspend.
When ready, it goes directly to `await_resume` to get the value,
as there is no suspension needed.
Otherwise, it will suspend itself and call `await_suspend` with a
`std::coroutine_handle` to its own promise.

NOTE: `std::coroutine_handle<void>` can be used for type erasure.


The __return_type__ is the result type of the `co_await expression`, e.g. `int`:

[source,cpp]
----
int i = co_await awaitable_with_int_result();
----

The return type of the `await_suspend` can be three things:

- `void`
- `bool`
- `std::coroutine_handle<U>`

If it is void the awaiting coroutine remains suspended. If it is `bool`,
the value will be checked, and if false, the awaiting coroutine will resume right away.

If a `std::coroutine_handle` is returned, this coroutine will be resumed.
The latter allows `await_suspend` to return the handle passed in,
being effectively the same as returning `false`.

If the awaiting coroutine gets re-resumed right away, i.e. after calling await_resume,
it is referred to as "immediate completion" within this library.
This is not to be confused with a non-suspending awaitable, i.e. one that returns `true` from `await_ready`.
