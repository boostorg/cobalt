[#wait_group]
== cobalt/wait_group.hpp

The `wait_group` function can be used to manage
multiple coroutines of type `promise<void>`.
It works out of the box with <<with>>, by having the matching `await_exit` member.

Essentially, a `wait_group` is a dynamic list of
promises that has a  `race` function (`wait_one`),
a `gather` function (`wait_all`) and will clean up on scope exit.
