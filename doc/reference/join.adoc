[#join]
== async/join.hpp

The `join` function can be used to `co_await` multiple <<awaitable>>s at once with properly connected cancellations.

The function will gather all completion and return them as values, unless an exception is thrown.
If an exception is thrown, all outstanding ops are cancelled (or detached if possible)
and the first exception gets rethrown.

NOTE: `void` will be returned as `variant2::monostate` in the tuple, unless all awaitables yield void.

It can be called as a variadic function with multiple <<awaitable>> or as on a range of <<awaitable>>s.

[source,cpp]
----
async::promise<void> task1();
async::promise<void> task2();

async::promise<void> do_join()
{
  co_await async::join(task1(), task2()); // <1>
  std::vector<async::promise<void>> aws {task1(), task2()};
  co_await async::join(aws); // <2>
}
----
<1> Wait for a variadic set of <<awaitable>>s
<2> Wait for a vector of <<awaitable>>s

The `join` will invoke the functions of the `awaitable` as if used in a `co_await` expression.
