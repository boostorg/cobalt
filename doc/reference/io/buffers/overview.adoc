==  Overview

Boost.Buffers is a portable, low-level C++ library which provides
containers and algorithms for describing contiguous buffers of
arbitrary bytes.

Boost.Buffers offers these features:

* Require only C++11
* Works without exceptions
* Fast compilation, few templates
* Does not require Asio

=== Requirements

* Requires Boost and a compiler supporting at least C++20
* Aliases for standard types use their Boost equivalents
* Link to a built static or dynamic Boost library, or use header-only (see below)
* Supports `-fno-exceptions`, detected automatically
