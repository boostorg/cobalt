== async/config.hpp

The config adder allows to config some implementation details of boost.async.

=== executor_type

The executor type defaults to `boost::asio::io_context::executor_type`.

You can set it to `boost::asio::any_io_executor` by defining `BOOST_ASYNC_USE_ANY_IO_EXECUTOR`
or to any executor you may want to use by defining `BOOST_ASYNC_EXECUTOR`, like so:

```cpp
#define BOOST_ASYNC_EXECUTOR ::boost::asio::any_io_executor
```

NOTE: You will need to make sure that the executor is single threaded.

=== pmr

Boost.async can be used with different pmr implementations, defaulting to `std::pmr`.

The following macros can be used to configure it:

 - `BOOST_ASYNC_USE_STD_PMR`
 - `BOOST_ASYNC_USE_BOOST_CONTAINER_PMR`
 - `BOOST_ASYNC_USE_CUSTOM_PMR`

If you define `BOOST_ASYNC_USE_CUSTOM_PMR` you will need to provide a `boost::async::pmr` namespace,
that is a drop-in replacement for `std::pmr`.
